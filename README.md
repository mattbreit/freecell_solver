# freecell_solver

WARNING: VERY experimental early stage of development. Brute force algorithm that either takes forever or crashes when it runs out of memory.  Any collab warmly appreciated :-)

Next steps for development:
implement some heuristics and use Dykstra's algorithm
use ML to determine heuristics automatically?
